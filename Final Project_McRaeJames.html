<h1>Background Info on author</h1>
<p>I am James McRae and I have zero experience with web development. </p>
<p>The creation of this website is to express why Giannis is one of if not the best player the Milwaukee Bucks have ever seen in addition to show how Giannisâ€™ playstyle has staked up against players like Kareem Abdul Jabbar or other top tier players. 
I am interested because Giannis is one of my favorite players to watch because of the dominate playstyle similar to how Shaq plays. </p>
<p>My target audience is towards the basketball community. 
They would be interested because it will be a topic that either people will disagree and provide why but also the people who agree and will support why. 
They will gain knowledge about Giannis and will likely have an effect on where people rank him on the goat scale. </p>
